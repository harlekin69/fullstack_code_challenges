There has been a lot of redundat code. This will work for smaller projects but as soon as just adding on new stragetype almost every pice of this class has to be touched.
Therfor seperating storage logics while keeping an eye also on possible memory fatigue needs to be done to keep a kleen way.
Yes, this might be a little over for small projects but as it grows this way it shure keeps things kleen and 'viewable' to any upcoming developer.
